The idea is to make it easy for engineers to analyze data and share insights. The following flows are planned.

* Define a database source
* Define a query that runs on that database, it will be exposed and cached via a web api.
* Define a vizualization of that query.
* Further down the line we may want to allow exploring database sources (reflection). And processing of data.
